Doubt.\
\
It's something we've all experienced at some point.\
\
In our career, It can make us question our abilities and our skills. It leaves us feeling unsure that we are at the right place, at the right time.\
\
But isn't doubt also natural as a part of growth and progress?\
\
It should push us to question ourselves and strive for improvement, even if it leaves us feeling uncertain.\
\
Today, I find myself grappling with doubt ðŸ˜”\
\
It has made me question my abilities and my place. But Instead of letting it defeat me, I want to use it as a motivator. (Although that's easier said than done ðŸ™„)\
\
I've taken steps to improve my skills, be more open to criticism, and increase my efficiency in my work. But it's not always clear if those steps will lead to a positive outcome.\
\
Is doubt a weakness?\
\
Some say it is, especially here on LinkedIn, where influencers recommend you exert confidence at all times.\
\
But don't be ashamed to be in doubt. Doubt is a sign that we care about our work and want to be the best we can be, even if navigating it is challenging.\
\
In those difficult times, one thing is sure: doubt is a part of the journey, whether we like it or not. By facing it, we should allow ourselves to keep growing, learning, and striving for a better tomorrow.\
